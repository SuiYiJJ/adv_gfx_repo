Introduction

Natural daylight brought into a interior space can help reduce 
overall artificial lighting cost in addition to provide 
inhabitants an alternative to fluorescent lighting.

Abstract

As an extension of current research done in architectural 
day-lighting simulation I provided a visualization for furniture 
arrangement. Running GPU-Accelerated photon mapping to approximate 
lighting in an given interior space we offer an extension to 
current false color visualization with comparative lighting units 
including foot-candle. In addition we focus on furniture :
arrangement of office spaces and offer an easy way for users to 
define spacial hierarchy between sets of furniture. The 
positions of the furniture visualized are sequences of positions 
generated by solving an optimization of a cost function. 
Moreover, the created cost function takes natural lighting into 
consideration.
