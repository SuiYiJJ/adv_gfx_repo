TODO:

  Need to find out how searching goes?
    * each primitives has a class that inherties that class
    * spheres are one

  What does virtual mean?
    * it is a function that is meant to be overridden
      as in promises made to make this later in another
      related/inhertied class

  What does setting a function = 0 mean?
    * means its a pure virtual implementation
      meaning that it HAS to be made, or else
      compiler will get angry and eat your babies
