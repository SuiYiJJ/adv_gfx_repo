Claims:

  *Global reflection distro function 
  *Not "geared" towards any specific algorithms

Introduction:
  
  There complex problem of simulation the behavior of light is hard to model exactly. Including that of global illumination

  We therefore simplify the problem and assumptions.

  NEW FORUMATION OF GLOBAL ILLUMINATION PROBLEM

  Praise to Goral for Radiosity

  Fredholm equation of the second kind? <--DeFaq is that?

  Most Global Illumination alg, are 2 pass methods
	Pass 1 -> Radiosity
	Pass 2 -> Tracing
	(-) Bad on storage
	(+) Hanrahan and Christensen only focus on imporant light contrbutions.
	(+) Added stuff

  Math and jazz
  	L(x,0_x)
