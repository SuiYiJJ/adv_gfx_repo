The Rendering Equation

	Everything everyones been trying to do is reduced to this equation.

	We reduced the big bad equation into a much smaller one for you whimps.

	I(x,x') is strength of the light PASSING from  x' --> x
	g(x,x') is magic "geometry" term
	e(x,x') is strength of the light EMIITTED from x' --> x
	p(x,x',x'') is strength of light SCATTERED 
		form x'' --> x by patch as surface x'

	This baby equation has the spirt of radiosity!
	ENGLISH MOTHER FUCKER: "the transport of intensity of light from one surface point to another is simply the sum of the emiited light and the total light intensity which is scatted towards x from all other surface points"

	It's even better then radiosity!!
	It has no assumption about reflectance of a specific surface, fuck that shit!

	Unoccluded Mutlipoint Transport Quantities!

	Maxwell's demon all up in here, no not really
	but his equations are nice too!

	Other stuff I glanced over

Discussion of Transport Quantities

Unoccluded 2 point transport intensity (Transport Intensity)



RESULTS
	
	What the fuck is Varience Reduction?
		Hierarchial Sampling is a kind of varience reduction tech
		
	Why is it important?

	Multidimensional Sequence Sampling?
