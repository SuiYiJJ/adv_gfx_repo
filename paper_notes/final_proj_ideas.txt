Computer-aid furniture placement to maximize the utility of natural lighting.

For my final project I would like to extend current research being done with natural lighting in the CS Graphics group at RPI. 

Specifically I would like extend the over/under illumination feature used in the this paper:
 	
 	Physical Avatars in a Projector-Camera Tangible User Interface Enhance Quantitative Simulation Analysis and Engagement 

 	http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/publications/nasman_ccd_procams_2013.pdf

I would like to able to give a realistically possible arrangement of furniture in a room that makes the best use of natural lighting.

The best use of natural lighting being defined as:
	
	Items that suffer of glare are placed/oriented in locations and directions to minimize glare

	Items that usually require lighting (artificial or natural) are preferred to be placed in natural daylight (minimize unused natural lighting)

	Items that share common placements (chairs around tables) are placed as so.

	Items are not too close to each other (as in not everything is jammed under the window)

	Others (depending on time/complexity)

The items I would consider would be mainly geared towards office spaces, such as desk/tables/cubical/computers.

I would probably borrow ideas presented in the following research papers:
